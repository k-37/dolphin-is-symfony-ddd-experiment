# Introduction

This repository is used to practice [Symfony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony) and [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). Commit messages will have detailed description which commands, documentation and other resources were used along the way. The goal is to have information on *why* and *how* in addition to *what* has changed. [`git blame`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-blame) and `git log` can be used to follow along, commit history can be seen as a tutorial. Commit Driven Learning (CDL). ü§Ø

# Requirements

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
- If you are using Windows, you have to install [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) to use the `make` command. Check out this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2532234/633864) for more explanations.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is developed on [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/) if you use another OS have that in mind if something doesn't work as expected.
