# Introduction

This repository is used to practice [Symfony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony) and [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). Commit messages will have detailed description which commands, documentation and other resources were used along the way. The goal is to have information on *why* and *how* in addition to *what* has changed. [`git blame`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-blame) and `git log` can be used to follow along, Commit Driven Learning (CDL) ü§Ø. Commit history can be seen as a tutorial.

# Requirements

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
- If you are using Windows, you have to install [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) to use the `make` command. Check out this [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2532234/633864) for more explanations.

> [!NOTE]
> The project is developed on [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/) if you use another OS have that in mind if something doesn't work as expected.

# Install Symfony

To build Docker images, after cloning current repository in the project root execute:

    make build

To install Symfony inside Docker container and start the application:

    make up

`make up` will install Symfony only if it is not already installed.

# Usage

After installation app should be available at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

# PhpStorm

### Debugging

- [Debugging with Xdebug and PHPStorm](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker/blob/6b37be14c98583e202cbbdec380c6e9e3103d2ab/docs/xdebug.md#debugging-with-xdebug-and-phpstorm)

### Remote interpreter

- On `File > Settings > PHP` we need to add interpreter which is inside container with the option `CLI Interpreter` using  `...` on the right side. For the option `Configuration files` we **must add both** `compose.yaml` and `compose.override.yaml`.
- On `File > Settings > PHP > Composer > Execution > Remote Interpreter > CLI Interpreter` select added interpreter.
- On `File > Settings > PHP > Test Frameworks` click on `+` and select remote interpreter. For the option `Path to script` we **must type** absolute path inside container `/app/vendor/autoload.php` and click refresh button on the right side, for the option `Default configuration file` **type** `/app/phpunit.xml.dist`. The bootstrap file can be skipped because it will be guessed from the config file.

# Troubleshooting

### Permissions outside container

As explained [here](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker/blob/6b37be14c98583e202cbbdec380c6e9e3103d2ab/docs/troubleshooting.md#editing-permissions-on-linux), on GNU/Linux after installing Symfony `git diff` will complain `...Not a git repository...`, because files created inside container will have ownership set to `root` user, to fix that we need to set ownership to the current user outside the container with command:

    docker compose run --rm php chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) .

or:

    make ownership
